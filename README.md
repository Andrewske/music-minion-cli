# 🎵 Music Minion CLI

> A contextual music curation tool that learns your preferences over time

Music Minion CLI is a smart music player that goes beyond simple ratings. Instead of static 5-star systems, it captures **when** and **why** you like songs, building a temporal understanding of your musical taste that evolves throughout the day, week, and seasons.

### External Control (IPC)

Control Music Minion from any terminal or script:

```bash
# Playback control
music-minion-cli play                 # Play current/next track
music-minion-cli skip                 # Skip to next track

### Temporal Context Capture

Every rating includes automatic context capture:

- **Time**: Hour and day of week
- **Session**: What played before/after
- **Patterns**: How this compares to previous ratings

Example output:
```
❤️  Loved: Daft Punk - Around the World
   Loved on Wednesday at 15:32
   BPM: 123, Key: F# minor
```

### Music Library Setup

Configure library paths in `~/.config/music-minion/config.toml`:

```toml
[music]
library_paths = ["~/Music", "/media/music"]
supported_formats = [".mp3", ".m4a", ".wav", ".flac"]
scan_recursive = true
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Configuration Files

Music Minion stores configuration in:
- **Config**: `~/.config/music-minion/config.toml`
- **Database**: `~/.local/share/music-minion/music_minion.db`
- **Logs**: `~/.local/share/music-minion/logs/`

### Key Settings

```toml
[music]
library_paths = ["~/Music"]          # Directories to scan
supported_formats = [".mp3", ".m4a"] # File types to include
scan_recursive = true                # Include subdirectories

[player]
volume = 50                         # Default volume (0-100)
shuffle_on_start = true            # Start in shuffle mode

[ai]
enabled = false                    # Enable AI note processing
openai_api_key = "your-key-here"   # OpenAI API key (optional)
model = "gpt-4o-mini"             # AI model for analysis

[ui]
show_progress_bar = true          # Show playback progress
use_colors = true                 # Colorful terminal output
history_length = 10               # Recent songs to display

[providers.soundcloud]
# OAuth tokens (auto-populated via `library auth soundcloud`)
access_token = ""
refresh_token = ""

[providers.spotify]
# OAuth tokens (auto-populated via `library auth spotify`)
client_id = "your-client-id"
client_secret = "your-client-secret"
access_token = ""
refresh_token = ""
```

**Note**: Provider OAuth tokens are automatically managed after running `library auth <provider>`. No manual configuration needed.

### Core Technologies

- **Audio**:
  - MPV with JSON IPC for local/SoundCloud playback
  - Spotify Web Playback SDK for Spotify Premium streaming
- **Metadata**: Mutagen library for MP3/M4A tag reading/writing
- **Database**: SQLite for ratings, context, temporal data, provider state
- **UI**: blessed for full-screen terminal with functional patterns
  - Three-tier rendering (full/input/partial for flicker-free updates)
  - Immutable state management via dataclasses
- **Logging**: loguru for centralized logging with rotation
- **Config**: Python's built-in tomllib for TOML configuration
- **Providers**:
  - spotipy for Spotify Web API integration
  - OAuth 2.0 + PKCE for secure provider authentication
- **AI**: OpenAI API for intelligent tagging and learning
- **IPC**: Unix sockets for external control
- **Dev Tools**: watchdog for hot-reload during development

### Database Schema

Key tables (v17+):
- **tracks**: File paths, metadata, DJ info (key, BPM)
  - Multi-source: `source` column ('local', 'soundcloud', 'spotify')
  - Provider IDs: `soundcloud_id`, `spotify_id` for linking
- **ratings**: User feedback with timestamps and context
  - Source tracking: `source` column ('user', 'soundcloud', 'spotify')
- **notes**: Rich annotations linked to specific tracks
- **playback_history**: All played songs with timestamps
- **playlists**: Manual and smart playlists
- **provider_state**: OAuth tokens and provider-specific state
- **active_library**: Current active library ('local', 'soundcloud', 'spotify')

## 👨‍💻 Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd music-minion-cli

# Install development dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Install in development mode
uv pip install -e .

# Start with hot-reload for development
music-minion --dev

# Run tests (when available)
pytest

# Check code style
ruff check src/
ruff format src/
```

### Development Resources

- **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** - Comprehensive development guide
- **[ai-learnings.md](ai-learnings.md)** - Patterns and best practices
- **[docs/hot-reload-usage.md](docs/hot-reload-usage.md)** - Hot-reload development mode
- **[docs/ai-tag-review-system.md](docs/ai-tag-review-system.md)** - AI review system
- **[docs/playlist-system-plan.md](docs/playlist-system-plan.md)** - Implementation history

### Code Style Guidelines

- **Functional Programming**: Prefer functions over classes
- **Type Hints**: Required for all public functions
- **Single Responsibility**: Functions ≤20 lines, ≤3 nesting levels
- **Path Handling**: Use `pathlib.Path` over string paths
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for non-critical errors

### Contributing

1. Follow the functional programming approach outlined in `CLAUDE.md`
2. Add type hints to all functions
3. Write docstrings for public functions
4. Test cross-platform compatibility where relevant
5. Update README if adding new features

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**MPV not found**
```bash
# Check if MPV is installed
mpv --version

# Install MPV (see platform-specific instructions above)
```

**No music files found**
```bash
# Check your library paths
music-minion> init
# Edit ~/.config/music-minion/config.toml
# Add your music directories to library_paths
```

**Socket connection failed**
```bash
# Kill any hanging MPV processes
music-minion> killall

# Clear leftover socket files
rm /tmp/mpv-socket-*
```

**Database issues**
```bash
# Check database location
ls -la ~/.local/share/music-minion/

# Reinitialize if corrupted
music-minion> init
```

### Debug Logging

Enable detailed logging by setting environment variable:
```bash
export MUSIC_MINION_DEBUG=1
music-minion
```

Logs are written to `~/.local/share/music-minion/logs/`
