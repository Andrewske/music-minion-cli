# Music Minion CLI - Project Plan

## Project Overview
Build a CLI music player (`music-minion`) focused on contextual music curation through real-time feedback and learning user preferences over time.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Architecture Principles
- **Functional over Classes**: Use functions and modules, avoid complex class hierarchies
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function does one thing well (â‰¤20 lines, â‰¤3 nesting levels)
- **Simple & Expandable**: Build MVP first, design for easy feature addition later
- **Fail Fast**: Critical errors (missing mpv, no music) should exit with clear messages
- **Graceful Degradation**: Non-critical errors (AI failures, corrupted files) should log and continue

### Python CLI Best Practices
- **Entry Point**: Use `console_scripts` in setup.py/pyproject.toml for `music-minion` command
- **Command Parsing**: Start simple with input().split(), can upgrade to Click/Typer later  
- **Configuration**: Use TOML files in `~/.config/music-minion/`, load with tomllib
- **Logging**: Two levels - user-facing errors and detailed debug logs
- **Cross-Platform**: Use pathlib for paths, handle platform differences in mpv socket paths
- **Dependencies**: Keep minimal - mutagen (metadata), openai (optional), rich/textual (UI)

### Project Structure
```

â”œâ”€â”€ src/music_minion/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py          # Entry point and interactive loop
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ player.py        # mpv integration and control
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ library.py       # Music scanning and metadata
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database.py      # SQLite operations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ai.py           # OpenAI integration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.py       # Configuration loading

â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### Code Style
- Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- Prefer pathlib.Path over string paths  
- Use context managers for file/database operations
- Keep business logic separate from UI code
- Write docstrings for public functions

### File Organization
- **Single Purpose Files**: Each module should contain only related functions
- **Utility Functions**: Create `utils/` folder for reusable code (formatting, validation, etc.)
- **Avoid Duplication**: If code appears in multiple places, extract to shared utility
- **Clear Dependencies**: Files should import what they need, avoid circular imports

## Current Tasks (MVP)

### Core Architecture Setup
- Create Python project structure with `music-minion` package using UV
- Set up `music-minion` command with `music-minion init` for setup/configuration
- Auto-install mpv dependency during initialization  
- Implement basic music library scanning for configurable paths (MP3/M4A/WAV focus)
- Create SQLite database for tracking ratings, context, and notes
- Set up logging system (error log + detailed debug log)

### Basic Playback Integration  
- Integrate with mpv (cross-platform, JSON IPC control) for actual audio playback
- Implement basic shuffle functionality through entire library
- Create simple terminal interface showing current song and progress

### Rating System & AI Integration
- Implement interactive commands: `archive`, `skip`, `like`, `love`, `note "text"`
- Store ratings with timestamp and context (time of day, day of week)
- AI note processing (GPT-4o-mini): auto-process after song ends (unless archived)
- Commands: `ai setup <key>`, `ai analyze library`, `ai process batch`
- Preserve existing tags on AI failures, graceful error handling
- Basic metadata writing to files using mutagen library

### Terminal UI (Simple TUI)
- Current song display with progress bar
- Show DJ metadata: year, genre, key, BPM, existing notes
- AI-extracted tags when available
- Recent history (last 5-10 songs with ratings)
- Basic session stats (songs rated, time played)

## Future Features (Post-MVP)

### Enhanced Context Tracking
- Weather integration for mood correlation
- Activity tagging during rating
- Pattern recognition (genre preferences by time/day)
- Smart playlist generation based on historical patterns

### Advanced Rating & Curation

## Detailed Notes from Development Session

### Original Inspiration & Context
Kevin has been thinking about building a better way to rate his local music collection. The idea centers around a USB button controller with 3+ buttons:
- **Never** - Archive the song (remove from rotation)
- **Not Now** - Skip but don't penalize (mood-dependent)
- **Yes** - Like/Love the song

The core insight is that music preference is highly contextual - a song might always get "not now" at 10am but "love" at 4pm. Static ratings miss this temporal dimension.

### Evolution from Static Ratings to Contextual Curation
Instead of simple 1-5 star ratings, Music Minion tracks:
- **When** you like songs (time of day, day of week)
- **Context** around decisions (what played before, session mood)
- **Preference drift** over time (how your relationship with songs changes)
- **Memory association** through notes and tagging

### Architecture Decisions Made

#### Music Player Integration
**Challenge:** Building a music player from scratch is complex.
**Solution:** Integrate with MPD (Music Player Daemon)
- Runs as background service
- Controllable via CLI from anywhere
- Handles audio complexity while we focus on curation logic
- Python integration via `python-mpd2`

#### Control While in Other Applications
**Hybrid Approach Decided:**
```
USB Buttons â†’ System Hotkeys (F13-F15) â†’ Vibe Daemon â†’ MPD
Terminal Commands (mm love) â†’ Vibe Daemon â†’ MPD
Web UI (future) â†’ Vibe Daemon â†’ MPD
```

This allows rating from anywhere without needing the terminal focused.

#### Metadata Strategy
**Dual approach for DJ compatibility:**
- Write actual ratings to file metadata using mutagen
- Store rich context data in separate SQLite database
- Format: "085 - Great buildup, drops at 1:32" in comment field

### User Library Profile
- **Primary:** MP3 (4,766 files) 
- **Secondary:** M4A (368 files)
- **Location:** `~/Music`
- **Platform:** Linux (start here, expand later)

### Terminal Interface Vision

### Command Structure
- **Primary:** `music-minion` (users can create alias to `mm` if desired)
- **Package:** `music-minion` 
- **Interactive mode:** `music-minion` (opens TUI with commands like `play`, `love`, `skip`, `note "text"`)

### Development Philosophy
- **Simplicity First:** MVP before features
- **Context-Aware:** Time and patterns are first-class data
- **Local Control:** Works offline, user owns data
- **Speed Optimized:** Rating commands should be instant
- **Linux First:** Expand to other platforms later

### Key Innovation Points
1. **Temporal Intelligence:** Understanding that music preference changes throughout day/week/season
2. **Memory Palace Concept:** Linking songs to life moments and emotions
3. **Curation vs Consumption:** Focus on building relationship with music, not just playing it
4. **Context Preservation:** Capturing the "why" behind musical choices
5. **Evolution Tracking:** How taste changes over time

### Potential Challenges Identified
- MPD setup complexity for non-technical users
- Global hotkey permissions on different systems
- USB controller mapping across platforms
- Performance with large music libraries
- Metadata corruption risk when writing to files

### Future Integration Possibilities
- **Spotify:** Extend rating system to streaming
- **DJ Software:** Export curated metadata
- **Social:** Share musical discoveries
- **Analytics:** Mood and productivity correlation
- **Health:** Integration with sleep/exercise patterns
